# version-control-intro
A first-timer primer on getting started with git (& github/gitlab).

## the core functionality (live tutorial)
Git is a very powerful tool, and it can have quite the
learning curve. To keep it as simple as possible, we 
will focus on the absolute essentials for you to
get your project in version control and linked to a 
cloud repository, i.e. to make your project 'safe'.

### first steps

#### make a cloud account
For today, we will use "git.hhu.de", as our cloud service for demoing, because
we (HHU members) all _have_ an account. However, in the "real world" you'll
generally want to use a cloud service such as "github.com" or "gitlab.com".

#### make a repository
We'll do this with our cloud service (easiest), and `clone`
it to our own machine in a minute.

##### git.hhu.de
Click on the blue "new project" button

![look for "new project" on git.hhu.de](images/gitlab_new.png)

and then on "blank project"


##### github.com

Click on the green "new" button.

##### Both
Fill in project/repository name and other fields
as desired. In particular, it is normally quite important
to decide if it should be Public/Private. What is private,
can later be made public, but what is once public, will 
never truly be private again. 

Click on "create project"/"create repository".

The cloud services will _generally_ try and provide
"next step" instructions. These are _generally_ worth
a read, particularly if you're doing something different
from what we will do today (e.g. setting up an _existing_ repository)

#### install git
Alright, we have the "remote" or the "cloud service" setup,
now let's setup our local working space

- OsX, Windows: Download and install git from https://git-scm.com
- Linux: `sudo apt install git`

Especially under windows, but optionally elsewhere,
you may want one or more 
#### start tracking your project history
Moving on to getting a local copy of the project.

Generally speaking, we will 

#### access your project history

### the cloud (backup and access anywhere)
clone/pull/push/etc...

also access (ssh keys)

## muscle building (not live tutorial)
### larger projects and collaboration
#### branches
#### merge conflicts

### data storage
lsf

### keeping it clean
stash, squash, rebase & co
