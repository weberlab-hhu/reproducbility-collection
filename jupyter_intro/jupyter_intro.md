# jupyter
Mixing markdown, code, and code results

## install 
Installing jupyter will of course be platform dependent. 

Frequently you will be able to do it with `pip` or `conda`,
e.g. `pip install jupyter` or `pip install --user jupyter`

Please see https://jupyter.org/install for more.

## start
From your directory of interest (i.e. containing or parental
to the directory containing your notebook).

Run `jupyter notebook`.

A webserver starts, and your browser should then open to 
a view of your current folder. Open an existing or make
a new notebook and try it out.

See the jupyter\_demo.ipynb file for examples and discussion.
